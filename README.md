## Description

Challenge 19 -- Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

This project was built so that a user can easily access a text editor, either inside the website, or by installing it as its own application on your desktop. The app is a single-page application that meets PWA criteria and features several data persistence techniques that allows functionality also offline through the installed application. This project was built with the IDB (IndexedDB) package, and was completed off the starter code, given by the assignment. 

When you first enter the site, you're able to see the text editor, usable online through the site as is. However, you can also click the 'Install' button in the top left corner and install the app onto your computer for later, or offline, use. Type to your heart's content!

## Installation

- For application-specific use, please see the [Description](#description) section.

- For coding purposes: 

    * Please have installed Node JS before attempting to run the program (I have v20.10.0)

    * Please also install the dependencies inside the code shown in the package.json -- For ease of installation, I have implemented a script, so simply in your terminal just type `npm run install` and it will install the main dependencies and the other package.json's within the app. 

    * (The list of required dependencies for manual installation is: express.js, webpack, webpack-dev-server, webpack-pwa-manifest, babel, css-loader, concurrently, and idb.)
